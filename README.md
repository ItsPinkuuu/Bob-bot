# Bob-bot
This is the Github page for the discord bot "Bob bot". 

On this page you will find information about news and updates surrounding the bot. 
You will also be able to submit requests for commands and features that you wish would be added. I cant garanti that I will add the feature you request but it doesnt hurt to requuest eithes way. 
Its also here you can report any bugs you incounter during your time with the bot. 

I hope you find this bot enjoyable. I'm pretty new to all this so new and exciting features will come as I learn more. 

P.S. Currently the bot is only online when I have my computer on but I will try to have it on for as much as possible.
